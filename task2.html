        <p class="bio">Hello! I am a passionate learner and aspiring technology professional with a deep interest in software development, web technologies, and data-driven problem solving. From a young age, I have been fascinated by how technology can transform everyday life and create opportunities for innovation. This curiosity pushed me to explore programming, design, and emerging technologies with a strong determination to build solutions that are not only functional but also impactful.  

I enjoy working on projects that challenge my creativity and allow me to develop practical skills. Whether it’s designing user-friendly websites, writing efficient code, or exploring new tools, I see every project as an opportunity to grow and expand my knowledge. Alongside my technical journey, I also focus on improving communication, teamwork, and leadership skills, which I believe are equally important in achieving success.  

My long-term goal is to contribute to the field of technology by building applications that solve real-world problems, inspire people, and make life easier. Beyond academics and coding, I take interest in continuous self-development, learning from experiences, and staying updated with industry trends. I strongly believe that persistence, adaptability, and a willingness to learn are the keys to achieving any dream.  

This webpage represents a small step in sharing my journey, my skills, and my aspirations with the world.</p>
